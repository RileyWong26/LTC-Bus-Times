<h1>Developping a deep learning model to accurately predict bus time arrival in London, Ontario. </h1>

<h3>Using an attention based LSTM model to be able to predict the delay on the arrival on the next stop.  </h3>

<h3>Using pytorch for implementation</h3>

<h1>Part 1</h1>
Researched a deep learning model architechture, that would provide the best predictions on the delay on given stops.  
The model that we found and researched was a BiLSTM model and an attention-based BiLSTM model.  <br>
Contains: <br>
<ul>
  <li>2 BiLSTM layers</li>
  <li>dropout layers</li>
  <li> then 3 output layers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 2</h2>
Intial data.  Began collecting data from different sources for datapoints in the model
